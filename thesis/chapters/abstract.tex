    In this thesis, three different approaches to the colorization of grayscale 
    photographs were described. Every approach used artificial neural networks
    as the colorizer. The architecture, learning process, results, and the 
    flaws and possible improvements were presented for each of the models.
    Before the models were described, an overview of deep learning concepts 
    and methods needed for the understanding of the used models was provided.
